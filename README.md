# How to use it

## Starting
After starting the application you'll be greated by a login screen, prompting you to either login from a file or create a new one. This idea was inspired from KeePassXC, indeed all the "save files" are encrypted!
## Main menu
Once the log in is complited you'll be welcomed by a table containing various crypto currencies, you can click on the to enable actions such as:
- buying
- selling
we might add more features.

On the top right of the screen you'll find your balance, you can add money at any time if you need to!

## Considerations
please keep in mind that all of this was made using free(as in cost) tools and thus we are limited to what our API provider provides us, and to what the other free tools avaiable lets us do.
We are limited expecially in API calls.
